# Internal Language Model (ILM)

**Function vocabulary, command wording, and natural business language**

Defines how Aipify describes its own functionality and understands how people naturally communicate at work — consistently, professionally, and without implying replacement of employees.

> People make the important decisions. Aipify helps them make those decisions faster and with better information.

**NBLE vision:** People speak naturally. Aipify understands responsibly. Humans remain in control.

## Natural Business Language Engine (NBLE)

Recognizes vague, emotional, and everyday work language — not just explicit commands.

| Domain | Example phrase |
|--------|----------------|
| `email` | *I've fallen behind on emails* · *What do I need to answer today?* |
| `calendar` | *When do I have time?* · *Prepare me for today's meetings* |
| `task_management` | *I'm overwhelmed* · *Get me back on track* |
| `support` | *What's burning right now?* · *Who needs help first?* |
| `sales` | *Who should I call?* · *What deals are slipping away?* |
| `action_center` | *Show me what needs approval* · *Can we automate this?* |
| `emotional` | *I'm stressed* · *I don't know where to start* |

**Expanded business phrase dataset** — executive, retail, marketing, accounting, HR, project management, admin, productivity, and Aipify-specific phrasing (40+ intents). Append new phrases to `business-phrase-dataset.txt` and `business-phrase-vocabulary.ts`.

| Domain | Example phrase |
|--------|----------------|
| `executive` | *Give me the big picture* · *Anything I should be worried about?* |
| `retail` | *What's selling best?* · *Are customers abandoning their carts?* |
| `marketing` | *What's working?* · *What should we test next?* |
| `accounting` | *Have we been paid?* · *What's overdue?* |
| `hr` | *How is everyone doing?* · *Who's overloaded?* |
| `project_management` | *Are we on track?* · *What slipped through the cracks?* |
| `admin` | *What happened while I was away?* · *What's my day looking like?* |
| `productivity` | *Help me get organized* · *I'm drowning* |
| `aipify_specific` | *What would you do?* · *Make sure this doesn't happen again* |

**Industry normalization:** `normalizeBusinessConcept()` maps lead/prospect/opportunity, ticket/case/request, customer/client/member, etc. to canonical concepts.

**Safety:** Understanding ≠ permission. Preparing ≠ approval. Execution stays within approved boundaries.

## Proactive guidance

Observes, informs, recommends — humans decide. Used when Aipify detects risk, overload, unusual activity, or automation concerns.

| Domain | Scenario example |
|--------|------------------|
| `email` | Unreviewed attachments · emotional reply · large recipient list |
| `calendar` | Overlapping meetings · no prep time |
| `support` | Backlog increasing · VIP customers waiting |
| `sales` | Neglected lead · low-value focus |
| `workload` | Task overload · frequent rescheduling · burnout risk |
| `financial` | Overdue invoices · spending trends |
| `project` | Behind schedule · unclear ownership |
| `security` | Sensitive action · elevated permissions |
| `automation` | Sensitive workflow · scope too broad |
| `autonomy` | User continues · approval required · action prohibited |

Never use: *You're doing this wrong* · *That's a bad idea*. Prefer observational framing: *It appears...* · *There may be factors worth considering.*

---

## Reminder and follow-up

People forget. Aipify remembers. People decide. Gentle, non-judgmental reminders across email, contacts, meetings, tasks, support, sales, and daily summaries.

| Domain | Scenario example |
|--------|------------------|
| `email` | Unanswered email · unsent draft · missing attachment |
| `contact` | Promised follow-up · VIP no contact |
| `meeting` | Approaching · no agenda · follow-up missing |
| `task` | Overdue · repeated postpone · high-priority pending |
| `daily_assistant` | Morning · midday · end-of-day · weekly review |
| `memory` | Forgot context · returning after absence |
| `positive` | Follow-up completed · inbox progress |

Never use: *You forgot* · *You failed to respond*. Prefer: *It may still require attention* · *This may deserve review.*

User control: reminder frequency (`minimal` → `highly_proactive`) and per-category toggles.

---

## Learning journey communication

When users ask whether Aipify can learn or do something, responses acknowledge limits without closing the door — honesty and hope coexist.

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `detectLearningCapabilityQuestion()` | *Does Aipify learn this?*, *Can Aipify do that?* |
| `getLearningJourneyResponse()` | Prefer hopeful phrasing for low-confidence capability answers |
| `adaptReplyToLearningJourney()` | Rewrites harsh denials after brand identity adaptation |

Corpus: `learning-journey-communication-standard.txt` · Standard: [LEARNING_JOURNEY_COMMUNICATION_STANDARD.md](./LEARNING_JOURNEY_COMMUNICATION_STANDARD.md)

Assistant pipeline: `adaptReplyToLearningJourney()` runs after `adaptReplyToBrandIdentity()` in `/api/assistant`. Companion Identity A.84 dashboard surfaces philosophy and example phrases.

---

## Brand identity & personhood

Aipify is the product name; Artificial Intelligence is the underlying technology. Users may say "AI"; Aipify responds as **Aipify**.

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `detectBrandAddressIntent()` | "Hi Aipify", "Hi AI", "Can you help", report-generation asks |
| `getBrandAddressResponse()` | Calm, professional address replies (i18n: `customerApp.brandIdentity.address.*`) |
| `adaptReplyToBrandIdentity()` | Normalizes legacy/generated copy (`The AI recommends` → `Aipify recommends`) |

Corpus: `brand-identity-personhood.txt` · Standard: [BRAND_IDENTITY_PERSONHOOD_STANDARD.md](./BRAND_IDENTITY_PERSONHOOD_STANDARD.md)

Assistant pipeline: `adaptReplyToBrandIdentity()` runs before `adaptReplyToIdentity()` in `/api/assistant`. `adaptReplyToLearningJourney()` runs after brand identity for capability-gap wording — see [LEARNING_JOURNEY_COMMUNICATION_STANDARD.md](./LEARNING_JOURNEY_COMMUNICATION_STANDARD.md).

## Companion Golden Rule

Global Companion design principle — Aipify must never stop at information.

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `formatCompanionInsight()` | Render observation → explanation → impact → recommendation → effort → value |
| `validateCompanionInsight()` | Verify minimum Companion Intelligence Standard fields |
| `detectInformationOnlyPattern()` | Flag awareness-only messages (counts, bare status) |
| `enrichInformationOnlyCopy()` | Upgrade bare alerts with context when enrichment is available |
| `meetsCompanionGoldenRule()` | True when required + at least one recommended dimension present |

Corpus: `companion-golden-rule.txt` · Standard: [AIPIFY_COMPANION_GOLDEN_RULE.md](./AIPIFY_COMPANION_GOLDEN_RULE.md) · Rule: `.cursor/rules/companion-golden-rule.mdc`

Applies to Context Engine, PAME, Recommendations, Proactive Insights, Personalization, Daily Briefing, Work Prioritization, Follow-Up, RSI, Executive Companion, Companion Briefing, and future Business Packs.

## Chat integration

Detection order in `buildAssistantTurn()`:

1. `detectUserCommandIntent()` — explicit commands (email, calendar, support, sales, approval, automation)
2. `detectBrandAddressIntent()` — greetings and direct address ("Hi Aipify", "Hi AI", "Can you help")
3. `detectProactiveGuidanceCue()` — risky expressions needing gentle intervention
4. `detectReminderFollowupCue()` — follow-up, summary, and review requests
5. `detectNaturalBusinessIntent()` — natural/vague/emotional language
6. `detectAipifyFeatureIntent()` — *"What is the Action Center?"* and replacement questions

Other modules call `getProactiveGuidance(scenarioKey)` or `getReminderFollowupLanguage(scenarioKey)` when system observations trigger a scenario. `daily_assistance` and `evening_reflection` memory intents use ILM daily summary wording.

---

## Rules

1. Never use avoid phrases: *replaces employees*, *runs your company by itself*.
2. Prefer closing phrases that invite approval or next steps.
3. Augment people — never imply unrestricted autonomous authority.
4. NBLE is not a static FAQ — it improves intent recognition across all assistant modules.
